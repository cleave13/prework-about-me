      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am currently a consultant implementing Salesforce.com for my clients. I'm looking to develop my web development skillset to enhance my skills in my current position and open doors to entrpreneurial opportunities in the future.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Denver, CO</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy golfing, hiking, biking and spending time with family.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>If I could, I'd be a poet and philosopher, but that doesn't pay very well. My backup is entrepreneurship, specifically in real estate investing.</p>

      <p>Denver, CO</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have entrepreneurial ideas that I'm currently unable to bring alive due to gaps in my skillset. </p>
